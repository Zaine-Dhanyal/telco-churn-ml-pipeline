# telco-churn-ml-pipeline
This project builds an end-to-end machine learning pipeline to predict customer churn using the Telco Churn dataset. It includes data preprocessing, model training, hyperparameter tuning with GridSearchCV, and pipeline export for reusable and production-ready ML workflows.
# Objective
Build an end-to-end machine learning pipeline to predict customer churn using structured customer data.

# Approach
Data preprocessing (scaling & encoding) was implemented using Scikit-learn Pipeline, followed by training Logistic Regression and Random Forest models with hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV.

# Key Results
Logistic Regression achieved the best performance with strong accuracy and F1-score, and the complete pipeline was exported using joblib for reusability and production-ready deployment.
